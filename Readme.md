# Autoscaling Groups with Load balancer
In this project you are configuring three autoscaling groups across multiple availability zones with an application load balancer. The load balancer ensures traffic is evenly distributed to healthy instances, while autoscaling dynamically adjusts capacity for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
## Learning Objective
_Upon the completion of the project you will be able to deploy the infrastructure of healthy instances and dynamically adjust high availability and scalability._
- Autoscaling groups
- Load balancer
- Listener rules
- Launch templates
- User-data script
- Target groups
## Prerequisites
- Strong knowledge of Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.
- Understanding of autoscaling and load balancing concepts.
- Conceptual understanding of user-data script.
- Understanding of web application architecture.
- Knowledge of networking concepts (VPC, security groups).
# Step 1:- Logging in to the Amazon Web Services Console
Login to your AWS account using your AWS credentials
# Step 2:- Creating Security Groups
_You will configure security groups at the creation of launch templates but to skip this every time process you need to create your security group firstly and then you can select the existing security group_
- In the AWS management console search bar, search EC2 and click on EC2 service. 
- Click on the 'Security Groups' option -- which is on the right side of the console in 'Network & Security' section.
1. Click on 'create security group'
2. Enter Security group name -  Bikewale-SG
3. Enter description -- This Security group allows port - SSH-22, HTTP-80, HTTPS-443
4. In Inbound rules - click on 'Add rule'
    - Select type - SSH         Source - Custom     anywhere - 0.0.0.0/0
    - Select type - HTTP        Source - Custom     anywhere - 0.0.0.0/0
    - Select type - HTTPS       Source - Custom     anywhere - 0.0.0.0/0
5. In Outbound rules - by default all traffic is allowed, which means no need to change anything.
6. Click on - Create security group
# Step 3:- Creating Launch Templates
_In this project you are going to host web application through configure autoscaling groups and load balancer, so for the autoscaling groups you need to create templates of your web pages of the application using 'Launch templates'_
- click on the 'Launch templates'
- _you needs to create 3 launch templates for your web application._ 
### This template is for home page of the web application "Bikewale"
1. Click on 'Create launch template'
2. Enter the name of Launch template - Bikewale-LT
3. Enter description of template for your understanding.
4. Select OS image from Quick start - Amazon Linux
5. Select Instance type - t2.micro
6. Select key pair
7. in Network settings 
    - Subnet - When you specify a subnet, a network interface is automatically added to your template.
    - Firewall - You needs to select existing Security group which is creates by you -- Bikewale-SG
8. in Advanced details 
    - User-data - You need to pass user data script of your web application's home page that is 'Bikewale'
    - Script:-
        #!/bin/bash
        yum update -y
        yum install -y httpd
        systemctl start httpd
        systemctl enable httpd

5. Select- Bikewale-TG
6. Click on - Update
#### Bikewale Target group assigned with Bikewale auto-scaling group
##### Follow same process for BMW-ASG & KTM-ASG 
#### Now you are ready to configure Load Balancer
# Step 7:- Configure Application Load Balancer
_After create all those resources now you need to create an application load balancer and add listener rules in that_
1. Go to EC2 dashboard
2. Click on - Load balancers
3. Click on - Create load balancer
4. Select type of load balancer - Application load balancer
5. Click on Create
6. In basic configuration

    - Select your VPC
    - Select Availability Zones mapping
8. Select Security Group - Bikewale-SG
9. In listeners and routing - you have one default lister - HTTP:80 -- Forwards to - Bikewale-TG(It will be your home page)
10. Click on - Create load balancer
#### Application Load Balancer created successfully
# Step 8:- Configure Listener Rules
_Bikewale listener is configured at the creation of load balancer so now you need to create rule for BMW and KTM page_
### BMW
1. Open load balancer - Bikewale-LB
2. Go to Listener rules and the open default rule
3. Click on - Add rule
4. Enter Name and tags - BMW

# Step 9:- Test Your Infrastructure
_After Configure all those things now you are ready to test your web application using Bikewale-LB's DNS._
1. Open load balancer - Bikewale-LB
2. Copy DNS name of - Bikewale-LB (eg. bikewale-lb-xxxxxxxxxx.us.west-1b.elb.amazonaws.com)
3. Open new tab - Paste Copied DNS name

4. Enter path for BMW - (eg. bikewale-lb-xxxxxxxxxx.us.west-1b.elb.amazonaws.com/bmw/ )

5. Enter path for KTM - (eg. bikewale-lb-xxxxxxxxxx.us.west-1b.elb.amazonaws.com/ktm/ )

# Summary
In this project, you Configured 3 Auto scaling groups and Application load balancer in that  An auto-scaling group for an application load balancer is the configuration to make a web app highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable. Three auto-scaling groups- static, dynamic, and scheduled-are created in three availability zones each associated with specific launch templates having user-data scripts to accommodate different application pages (Bikewale, BMW, and KTM).
an Application load balancer distributes incoming traffic across healthy instances in ASGs. Listener rules and target groups route requests based on URL paths, such as /bmw and /ktm. Security groups, health checks, and scaling policies are further created to provide secure access and reliability while allowing dynamic scaling during changes in the number of concurrent users accessing the application.
